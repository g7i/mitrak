          The equivalency of any degree for admission to any programme will be
          decided by University. If a recognized university has an approved
          conversion formula of CGPA into percentage then it will be applicable
          on producing the certificate of conversion from the concerned
          University. Otherwise AICTE approved conversion formula will be used
          i.e. Equivalent percentage = (C.G.P.A -0.75) X 10.
