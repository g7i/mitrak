      <Paragraph>
        The graduating student must have excellent knowledge and skills in the
        area of his study. However, he must also have broad understanding of
        society and relationships. Character needs to be nurtured as an
        essential quality by which he would understand and fulfill his
        responsibility as an engineer, a citizen and a human being. Besides the
        above, several meta-skills and underlying values are needed.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        There is a mad rush for engineering today, without the student
        determining for himself his interests and his goals. This is a major
        factor in the current state of demotivation that exists among UG
        students towards studies. The success of gaining admission into a
        desired institution but failure in getting the desired branch, with peer
        pressure generating its own problems, leads to a peer environment that
        is demotivating and corrosive.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        To come out of this situation, a multi-pronged approach is needed. One
        will have to work closely with the newly joined students in making them
        feel comfortable, allow them to explore their academic interests and
        activities, reduce competition and make them work for excellence,
        promote bonding within them, build relations between teachers and
        students, give a broader view of life, and build character. When new
        students enter an institution, they also come with diverse thoughts,
        backgrounds and preparations. They come into a new unfamiliar
        environment, and many of them have little knowledge of a
        university/college. An important task, therefore, is to welcome the new
        students to higher education and prepare them for their new role.
        Transition from school to university/college life is one of the most
        challenging events in a studentâ€™s life.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Keeping this in mind, On 14th March 2017, AICTE approved a package which
        includes Student Induction Program. Purpose of the Student Induction
        Program is to help new students adjust and feel comfortable in the new
        environment, inculcate in them the ethos and culture of the institution,
        help them build bonds with other students and faculty members, and
        expose them to a sense of larger purpose and self-exploration.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Student Induction Program engages with the new students as soon as they
        come into the institution; regular classes start only after that.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        As per guidelines of AICTE, MITRC has constituted SIP Cell . The Process
