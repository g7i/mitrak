        B.Tech stands for Bachelor of Technology. This is an undergraduate
        course in engineering that awards you a degree at the end of four years
        of study. This degree in engineering is your stepping stone to a career
        in engineering. In India, B.Tech engineering courses are regulated by
        All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important for an engineer to not only possess great technical
        skills but also social and emotional intelligence. Compassion, empathy,
        insights, knowledge, logic, and skill must all combine. If the person
        has a curious, creative, and innovative mind who likes to dig deeper
        into problems and apply logical thinking and reasoning then engineering
        is a profession they could look into. B. Tech, through its four-year
        full-fledged learning path, teaches prevalent and useful technical
        skills along with interpersonal skills. It develops a team spirit in
        students, helps them to be more accurate and precise, provides a
        platform to improve their communication skills, and teaches them
        resilience and self-discipline.
