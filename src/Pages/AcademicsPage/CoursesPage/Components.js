        B.Tech stands for Bachelor of Technology. This is an undergraduate course in engineering that awards you a degree at the end of four years of study. This degree in engineering is your stepping stone to a career in engineering. In India, B.Tech engineering courses are regulated by All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).

      <p>
        It is important for an engineer to not only possess great technical skills but also social and emotional intelligence. Compassion, empathy, insights, knowledge, logic, and skill must all combine. If the person has a curious, creative, and innovative mind who likes to dig deeper into problems and apply logical thinking and reasoning then engineering is a profession they could look into. B. Tech, through its four-year full-fledged learning path, teaches prevalent and useful technical skills along with interpersonal skills. It develops a team spirit in students, helps them to be more accurate and precise, provides a platform to improve their communication skills, and teaches them resilience and self-discipline.
